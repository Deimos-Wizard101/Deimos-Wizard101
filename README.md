# Tutorial
## Instructions
1. Be sure all your clients are logged onto the desired wizard.
2. Run the ```Deimos.exe``` by double clicking it.

## Hotkeys
- Look in ```Deimos-config.ini``` to see what hotkeys are mapped.
- Any change to the config will require a restart of the tool.
- Refer to the discord server's reference channel for proper key names, they are case sensitive.
### Hotkey List
- X Press to all clients (`X` key by default)
- Sync XYZ of all clients (syncs client positions with selected client, `F8` by default)
- Navmap quest TP (selected client, `F7` by default)
- Navmap quest TP for all clients. Which client the teleport obeys varies depending on the scenario. (`F6` by default)
- Toggle speed multiplier (`F5` by default)
- Kill Deimos (`F9` by default)
- Toggle auto combat (`NINE` by default)
- Auto dialogue (`F4` by default)
- Auto questing (`F3` by default)
- Auto sigil (`F2` by default)
- Freecam (`F1` by default)
- TP to freecam position (`Shift + Freecam` Key by default)

## Important
- Don't bug the community or myself for when updates are coming. This is a free tool and will stay that way.
- There's also more advanced features in the GUI that are difficult to explain in writing. Those are intended for more advanced users and/or script developers. No support will be provided on them.
- Additionally, minimal support will be provided on auto questing and auto sigil. This is highly generalized code by design and it is impossible to fix every issue or every circumstance.

## Other
The GUI also has a bot creator and flythrough creator. Information on these systems are in the bots/flythroughs channels of the Deimos discord server, or the [wiki](https://github.org/Deimos-Wizard101/Deimos-Wizard101/wiki).
